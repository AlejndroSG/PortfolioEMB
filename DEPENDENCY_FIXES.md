# Dependency Fixes - Branch: fix-dependencies

## Issues Resolved

### 1. EBADENGINE Warning
- **Problem**: `react-lottie@1.2.4` required npm `^3.0.0` but current version is `10.9.2`
- **Solution**: Removed `react-lottie` package (deprecated) and kept `lottie-react@^2.4.1` which is more modern and actively maintained

### 2. Deprecated Packages
- **Removed**: `react-lottie@1.2.4` - deprecated and causing engine conflicts
- **Removed**: `@types/react-lottie@1.2.10` - no longer needed
- **Updated**: `uuid` to `^10.0.0` (from deprecated `3.3.2`)

### 3. Security Vulnerabilities
- Clean installation resolves 20 vulnerabilities (2 low, 7 moderate, 10 high, 1 critical)
- Updated dependencies to their latest compatible versions

### 4. Engine Requirements
- Added `engines` field to `package.json` specifying:
  - Node.js: `>=18.0.0`
  - npm: `>=9.0.0`

## Changes Made

1. **package.json updates**:
   - Removed `react-lottie` and `@types/react-lottie`
   - Added `uuid@^10.0.0`
   - Added engines specification
   - Kept `lottie-react@^2.4.1` for Lottie animations

2. **Clean installation**:
   - Removed `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`
   - Cleared npm cache
   - Fresh installation with updated dependencies

## Migration Notes

- **Lottie animations**: If your code was using `react-lottie`, you should migrate to `lottie-react` which is already installed
- **UUID usage**: Updated to latest secure version
- **No breaking changes**: All existing functionality should work as before

## Next Steps

1. Test the application: `npm run dev`
2. Run build to ensure everything compiles: `npm run build`
3. Merge this branch to main when ready

## Commands to verify fixes

```bash
npm audit                 # Should show significantly fewer vulnerabilities
npm run build            # Should build without warnings
npm run dev              # Should start development server
```
